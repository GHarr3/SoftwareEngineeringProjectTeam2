//Photon UI – Splash & Player Entry Screens
//Joseph Bertel 

This piece of the project implements a browser based user interface for the Photon game system.
The UI was built using standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and
runs locally in a web browser.

What was implemented:
- A splash screen that displays the Photon logo and initialization state
- Player entry screen similar to prof Strothers with red and green team layouts
- Styled it to match the look and feel of the original system
- Basic ui flow from splash screen to entry screen

How to run:
1. Open index.html in a web browser (Firefox recommended)
   -In debian: xdg-open index.html
   -Or open the file directly in a browser
